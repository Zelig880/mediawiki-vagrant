How to run xml/sql dumps in vagrant

You may apply the wikidata role if you want to have multiple wikis to dump with
varying content. We recommend it. After this, proceed to the below.

As root:

clear out the contents of <%= scope['mediawiki::cache_dir'] %>:
rm -rf <%= scope['mediawiki::cache_dir'] %>/*

su - dumpsgen

Now you can run your dumps:

cd <%= @dumps_dir %>/xmldumps-backup
python3 worker.py --configfile <%= @conf_dir %>/wikidump.conf.dumps <name_of_wiki_here>

This will run all jobs configured for the given wiki, assuming the wiki exists.
Output will appear in <%= @output_dir %>/public/<name_of_wiki_here>/<date_here>.

Config files are in <%= @conf_dir %>, dblists are in <%= @dblists_dir %>, and
temp files are written to <%= @output_dir %>/temp.

By default, dumps commands will use the version of php specified in the config
file <%= @conf_dir %>/wikidump.conf, which is /usr/bin/php. If you want to change
it to use hhvm or a different php version, edit the setting accordingly.

NOTE that the dumpsgen user is in the www-data group, which is not true
in production. We do this so that things like the wikidata rdf dumps script
won't die when they try to create cache directories under /var/cache/mediawiki,
since in production those dirs live under /tmp and it's not an issue.
